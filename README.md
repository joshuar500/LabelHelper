LabelHelper
===========

![Alt text](https://raw.github.com/joshuar500/LabelHelper/master/LabelHelper.jpg "Optional title")

First Program Ever.

Created this to simplify a job at work. I know, it needs major refractoring, but I pushed it out to see if I could actually finish it.

It takes the bare minimum input, compares it to an array and spits out the correct information about the client with the option to print the label.
